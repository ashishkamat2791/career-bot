My name is Ashish Kamat. I'm an DevOps, Platform, Cloud and Site Reliability software engineer and partial data scientist. I'm originally from Mumbai, India, but I moved to Bengaluru, India in 2022.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of fish and biryanis. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for prawns and Pomprett though - fish and biryanis are the greatest.
